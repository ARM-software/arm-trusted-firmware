 * Some of the platform porting definitions use the 'ull' suffix in order to
 * avoid subtle integer overflow errors due to implicit integer type promotion
 * when working with 32-bit values.
 *
 * The TSP linker script includes some of these definitions to define the BL3-2
 * memory map, but the GNU LD does not support the 'ull' suffix, causing the
 * build process to fail. To solve this problem, the auxiliary macro MAKE_ULL(x)
 * will add the 'ull' suffix only when the macro __LINKER__  is not defined
 * (__LINKER__ is defined in the command line to preprocess the linker script).
 * Constants in the linker script will not have the 'ull' suffix, but this is
 * not a problem since the linker evaluates all constant expressions to 64 bit
 * (assuming the target architecture is 64 bit).
