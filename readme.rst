Trusted Firmware-A
==================

Trusted Firmware-A (TF-A) is a reference implementation of secure world software
for `Arm A-Profile architectures`_ (Armv8-A and Armv7-A), including an Exception
Level 3 (EL3) `Secure Monitor`_. It provides a suitable starting point for
productization of secure world boot and runtime firmware, in either the AArch32
or AArch64 execution states.

TF-A implements Arm interface standards, including:

-  `Power State Coordination Interface (PSCI)`_
-  `Trusted Board Boot Requirements CLIENT (TBBR-CLIENT)`_
-  `SMC Calling Convention`_
-  `System Control and Management Interface (SCMI)`_
-  `Software Delegated Exception Interface (SDEI)`_

The code is designed to be portable and reusable across hardware platforms and
software models that are based on the Armv8-A and Armv7-A architectures.

In collaboration with interested parties, we will continue to enhance TF-A
with reference implementations of Arm standards to benefit developers working
with Armv7-A and Armv8-A TrustZone technology.

Users are encouraged to do their own security validation, including penetration
testing, on any secure world code derived from TF-A.
