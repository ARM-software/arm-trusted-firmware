Chain of trust bindings
=======================

The device tree allows to describe the chain of trust with the help of
'cot' node which contain 'manifests' and 'images' as sub-nodes.
'manifests' and 'images' nodes contains number of sub-nodes (i.e. 'certificate'
and 'image' nodes) mentioning properties of the certificate and image respectively.

Also, device tree describes 'non-volatile-counters' node which contains number of
sub-nodes mentioning properties of all non-volatile-counters used in the chain of trust.

cot
------------------------------------------------------------------
This is root node which contains 'manifests' and 'images' as sub-nodes


Manifests and Certificate node bindings definition
----------------------------------------------------------------

- Manifests node
        Description: Container of certificate nodes.

        PROPERTIES

        - compatible:
                Usage: required

                Value type: <string>

                Definition: must be "arm, cert-descs"

- Certificate node
        Description:

        Describes certificate properties which are used
        during the authentication process.

        PROPERTIES

        - root-certificate
               Usage:

               Required for the certificate with no parent.
               In other words, certificates which are validated
               using root of trust public key.

               Value type: <boolean>

        - image-id
                Usage: Required for every certificate with unique id.

                Value type: <u32>

        - parent
                Usage:

                It refers to their parent image, which typically contains
                information to authenticate the certificate.
                This property is required for all non-root certificates.

                This property is not required for root-certificates
                as root-certificates are validated using root of trust
                public key provided by platform.

                Value type: <phandle>

        - signing-key
                Usage:

                For non-root certificates, this property is used to refer
                public key node present in parent certificate node and it is
                required property for all non-root certificates which are
                authenticated using public-key present in parent certificate.

                This property is not required for all root-certificates. If
                omitted, the root certificate will be validated using the
                default platform ROTPK. If instead the root certificate needs
                validating using a different ROTPK, the signing-key property
                should provide a reference to the ROTPK node to use.

                Value type: <phandle>

        - antirollback-counter
                Usage:

                This property is used by all certificates which are
                protected against rollback attacks using a non-volatile
                counter and it is an optional property.

                This property is used to refer one of the non-volatile
                counter sub-node present in 'non-volatile counters' node.

                Value type: <phandle>


        SUBNODES
            - Description:

              Hash and public key information present in the certificate
              are shown by these nodes.

            - public key node
                  Description: Provide public key information in the certificate.

                  PROPERTIES

                     This property provides the Object ID of public key
                     provided in the certificate with the help of which
                     public key information can be extracted.

                     Value type: <string>

            - hash node
                 Description: Provide the hash information in the certificate.

                 PROPERTIES

                 - oid
                     Usage:

                     This property provides the Object ID of hash provided in
                     the certificate with the help of which hash information
                     can be extracted.
