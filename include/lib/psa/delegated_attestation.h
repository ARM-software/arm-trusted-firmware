/**
 * The aim of these APIs to get a derived signing key (private only) for the
 * delegated attestation model and obtain the corresponding platform attestation
 * token. In the delegated attestation model the final token consist of more
 * than one subtokens which are signed by different entities. There is a
 * cryptographical binding between the tokens. The derived delegated attestation
 * key is bind to the platform token (details below).
 *
 * Expected usage model:
 *  - First rse_delegated_attest_get_delegated_key() API need to be called to
 *    obtain the private part of the delegated attestation key. The public part
 *    of key is computed by the cryptographic library when the key is
 *    registered.
 *  - Secondly the rse_delegated_attest_get_token() must be called to obtain
 *    platform attestation token. The hash of the public key (computed by
 *    the hash_algo indicated in the rse_delegated_attest_get_delegated_key()
 *    call) must be the input of this call. This ensures that nothing but the
 *    previously derived delegated key is bindable to the platform token.

/**
 * Get a delegated attestation key (DAK).
 *
 * The aim of the delegated attestation key is to enable other SW components
 * within the system to sign an attestation token which is different than the
 * initial/platform token. The initial attestation token MUST contain the hash
 * of the public delegated key to make a cryptographical binding (hash lock)
 * between the key and the token.
 * The initial attestation token has two roles in this scenario:
 *   - Attest the device boot status and security lifecycle.
 *   - Attest the delegated attestation key.
 * The delegated attestation key is derived from a preprovisioned seed. The
 * input for the key derivation is the platform boot status. The system can be
 * attestated with the two tokens together.
 *
 * ecc_curve     The type of the elliptic curve to which the requested
 *               attestation key belongs. Please check the note section for
 *               limitations.
 * key_bits      The size of the requested attestation key, in bits.
 * key_buf       Pointer to the buffer where the delegated attestation key will
 *               be stored.
 * key_buf_size  Size of allocated buffer for the key, in bytes.
 * key_size      Size of the key that has been returned, in bytes.
 * hash_algo     The hash algorithm that will be used later by the owner of the
 *               requested delegated key for binding it to the platform
 *               attestation token.
 *
 * Returns error code as specified in psa_status_t.
 *
 * Notes:
 *   - Currently, only the PSA_ECC_FAMILY_SECP_R1 curve type is supported.
 *   - The delegated attestation key must be derived before requesting for the
 *     platform attestation token as they are cryptographically linked together.
