Description
===========

The QorIQ® LS1043A processor is NXP's first quad-core, 64-bit Arm®-based processor for embedded networking.
The LS1023A (two core version) and the LS1043A (four core version) deliver greater than 10 Gbps of performance
in a flexible I/O package supporting fanless designs. This SoC is a purpose-built solution for small-form-factor
networking and industrial applications with BOM optimizations for economic low layer PCB, lower cost power
supply and single clock design. The new 0.9V versions of the LS1043A and LS1023A deliver addition power savings
for applications such as Wireless LAN and to Power over Ethernet systems.

Boot Sequence
=============


Bootrom --> ATF BL1 --> ATF BL2 --> ATF BL1 --> ATF BL31
--> BL32(Tee OS) --> ATF BL31 --> BL33(u-boot) --> Linux kernel


How to build
============

Build Procedure
---------------

-  Prepare AARCH64 toolchain.

-  Build u-boot and OPTee firstly, and get binary images: u-boot.bin and tee.bin

-  Build ATF for Nor boot

   Build bl1:

   .. code:: shell

       CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu- make PLAT=ls1043 bl1

   Build fip:

   .. code:: shell

       CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu- make PLAT=ls1043 fip \
       BL33=u-boot.bin NEED_BL32=yes BL32=tee.bin SPD=opteed

Deploy ATF Images
-----------------

-  Deploy ATF images on Nor flash Alt Bank.

   .. code:: shell

       => tftp 82000000  bl1.bin
       => pro off all;era 64100000 +$filesize;cp.b 82000000 64100000 $filesize

       => tftp 82000000  fip.bin
       => pro off all;era 64120000 +$filesize;cp.b 82000000 64120000 $filesize

   Then change to Alt bank and boot up ATF:

   .. code:: shell

       => cpld reset altbank
