 * The compatibility routine to construct the power domain tree description.
 * The assumption made is that the power domains correspond to affinity
 * instances on the platform. This routine's aim is to traverse to the target
 * affinity level and populate the number of siblings at that level in
 * 'power_domain_tree_desc' array. It uses the current affinity level to keep
 * track of how many levels from the root of the tree have been traversed.
 * If the current affinity level != target affinity level, then the platform
 * is asked to return the number of children that each affinity instance has
 * at the current affinity level. Traversal is then done for each child at the
 * next lower level i.e. current affinity level - 1.
 *
 * The power domain description needs to be constructed in such a way that
 * affinity instances containing CPUs with lower cpu indices need to be
 * described first.  Hence when traversing the power domain levels, the list
 * of mpidrs at that power domain level is sorted in the ascending order of CPU
 * indices before the lower levels are recursively described.
 *
 * CAUTION: This routine assumes that affinity instance ids are allocated in a
 * monotonically increasing manner at each affinity level in a mpidr starting
 * from 0. If the platform breaks this assumption then this code will have to
 * be reworked accordingly.
