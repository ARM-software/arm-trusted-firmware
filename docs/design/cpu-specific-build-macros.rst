Arm CPU Specific Build Macros
=============================

This document describes the various build options present in the CPU specific
operations framework to enable errata workarounds and to enable optimizations
for a specific CPU on a platform.

Security Vulnerability Workarounds
----------------------------------

TF-A exports a series of build flags which control which security
vulnerability workarounds should be applied at runtime.

-  ``WORKAROUND_CVE_2017_5715``: Enables the security workaround for
   `CVE-2017-5715`_. This flag can be set to 0 by the platform if none
   of the PEs in the system need the workaround. Setting this flag to 0 provides
   no performance benefit for non-affected platforms, it just helps to comply
   with the recommendation in the spec regarding workaround discovery.
   Defaults to 1.

-  ``WORKAROUND_CVE_2018_3639``: Enables the security workaround for
   `CVE-2018-3639`_. Defaults to 1. The TF-A project recommends to keep
   the default value of 1 even on platforms that are unaffected by
   CVE-2018-3639, in order to comply with the recommendation in the spec
   regarding workaround discovery.

-  ``DYNAMIC_WORKAROUND_CVE_2018_3639``: Enables dynamic mitigation for
   `CVE-2018-3639`_. This build option should be set to 1 if the target
   platform contains at least 1 CPU that requires dynamic mitigation.
   Defaults to 0.

-  ``WORKAROUND_CVE_2022_23960``: Enables mitigation for `CVE-2022-23960`_.
   This build option should be set to 1 if the target platform contains at
   least 1 CPU that requires this mitigation. Defaults to 1.

CPU Errata Workarounds
----------------------

TF-A exports a series of build flags which control the errata workarounds that
are applied to each CPU by the reset handler. The errata details can be found
in the CPU specific errata documents published by Arm:

-  `Cortex-A53 MPCore Software Developers Errata Notice`_
-  `Cortex-A57 MPCore Software Developers Errata Notice`_
-  `Cortex-A72 MPCore Software Developers Errata Notice`_

The errata workarounds are implemented for a particular revision or a set of
processor revisions. This is checked by the reset handler at runtime. Each
errata workaround is identified by its ``ID`` as specified in the processor's
errata notice document. The format of the define used to enable/disable the
errata workaround is ``ERRATA_<Processor name>_<ID>``, where the ``Processor name``
is for example ``A57`` for the ``Cortex_A57`` CPU.

Refer to :ref:`firmware_design_cpu_errata_implementation` for information on how to
write errata workaround functions.

All workarounds are disabled by default. The platform is responsible for
enabling these workarounds according to its requirement by defining the
errata workaround build flags in the platform specific makefile. In case
these workarounds are enabled for the wrong CPU revision then the errata
workaround is not applied. In the DEBUG build, this is indicated by
printing a warning to the crash console.

In the current implementation, a platform which has more than 1 variant
with different revisions of a processor has no runtime mechanism available
for it to specify which errata workarounds should be enabled or not.

The value of the build flags is 0 by default, that is, disabled. A value of 1
will enable it.

For Cortex-A9, the following errata build flags are defined :

-  ``ERRATA_A9_794073``: This applies errata 794073 workaround to Cortex-A9
   CPU. This needs to be enabled for all revisions of the CPU.

   link time to Cortex-A53 CPU. This needs to be enabled for some variants of
   revision <= r0p4. This workaround can lead the linker to create ``*.stub``
   sections.

-  ``ERRATA_A53_836870``: This applies errata 836870 workaround to Cortex-A53
   CPU. This needs to be enabled only for revision <= r0p3 of the CPU. From

DSU Errata Workarounds
----------------------

Similar to CPU errata, TF-A also implements workarounds for DSU (DynamIQ
Shared Unit) errata. The DSU errata details can be found in the respective Arm
documentation:

- `Arm DSU Software Developers Errata Notice`_.

Each erratum is identified by an ``ID``, as defined in the DSU errata notice
document. Thus, the build flags which enable/disable the errata workarounds
have the format ``ERRATA_DSU_<ID>``. The implementation and application logic
of DSU errata workarounds are similar to `CPU errata workarounds`_.

For DSU errata, the following build flags are defined:

-  ``ERRATA_DSU_798953``: This applies errata 798953 workaround for the
   affected DSU configurations. This errata applies only for those DSUs that
   revision is r0p0 (on r0p1 it is fixed). However, please note that this
   workaround results in increased DSU power consumption on idle.

-  ``ERRATA_DSU_936184``: This applies errata 936184 workaround for the
   affected DSU configurations. This errata applies only for those DSUs that
   contain the ACP interface **and** the DSU revision is older than r2p0 (on
   r2p0 it is fixed). However, please note that this workaround results in
   increased DSU power consumption on idle.

-  ``ERRATA_DSU_2313941``: This applies errata 2313941 workaround for the
   affected DSU configurations. This errata applies for those DSUs with
   revisions r0p0, r1p0, r2p0, r2p1, r3p0, r3p1 and is still open. However,
   please note that this workaround results in increased DSU power consumption
   on idle.

CPU Specific optimizations
--------------------------

This section describes some of the optimizations allowed by the CPU micro
architecture that can be enabled by the platform as desired.

-  ``SKIP_A57_L1_FLUSH_PWR_DWN``: This flag enables an optimization in the
   Cortex-A57 cluster power down sequence by not flushing the Level 1 data
   cache. The L1 data cache and the L2 unified cache are inclusive. A flush
   of the L2 by set/way flushes any dirty lines from the L1 as well. This
   is a known safe deviation from the Cortex-A57 TRM defined power down
   sequence. Each Cortex-A57 based platform must make its own decision on
   whether to use the optimization.

-  ``A53_DISABLE_NON_TEMPORAL_HINT``: This flag disables the cache non-temporal
   hint. The LDNP/STNP instructions as implemented on Cortex-A53 do not behave
   in a way most programmers expect, and will most probably result in a
   significant speed degradation to any code that employs them. The Armv8-A
   architecture (see Arm DDI 0487A.h, section D3.4.3) allows cores to ignore
   the non-temporal hint and treat LDNP/STNP as LDP/STP instead. Enabling this
   flag enforces this behaviour. This needs to be enabled only for revisions
   <= r0p3 of the CPU and is enabled by default.

-  ``A57_DISABLE_NON_TEMPORAL_HINT``: This flag has the same behaviour as
   ``A53_DISABLE_NON_TEMPORAL_HINT`` but for Cortex-A57. This needs to be
   enabled only for revisions <= r1p2 of the CPU and is enabled by default,
   as recommended in section "4.7 Non-Temporal Loads/Stores" of the
   `Cortex-A57 Software Optimization Guide`_.

- ''A57_ENABLE_NON_CACHEABLE_LOAD_FWD'': This flag enables non-cacheable
   streaming enhancement feature for Cortex-A57 CPUs. Platforms can set
   this bit only if their memory system meets the requirement that cache
   line fill requests from the Cortex-A57 processor are atomic. Each
   Cortex-A57 based platform must make its own decision on whether to use
   the optimization. This flag is disabled by default.

-  ``NEOVERSE_Nx_EXTERNAL_LLC``: This flag indicates that an external last
   level cache(LLC) is present in the system, and that the DataSource field
   on the master CHI interface indicates when data is returned from the LLC.
   This is used to control how the LL_CACHE* PMU events count.
   Default value is 0 (Disabled).

GIC Errata Workarounds
----------------------
-  ``GIC600_ERRATA_WA_2384374``: This flag applies part 2 of errata 2384374
   workaround for the affected GIC600 and GIC600-AE implementations. It applies
   to implementations of GIC600 and GIC600-AE with revisions less than or equal
   to r1p6 and r0p2 respectively. If the platform sets GICV3_SUPPORT_GIC600,
   then this flag is enabled; otherwise, it is 0 (Disabled).
