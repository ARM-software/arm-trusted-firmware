/**
 * TCON - declare a _tcon type containing canary variables.
 * @decls: the semi-colon separated list of type canaries.
 *
 * This declares a _tcon member for a structure.  It should be the
 * last element in your structure; with sufficient compiler support it
 * will not use any actual storage.  tcon_check() will compare
 * expressions with one of these "type canaries" to cause warnings if
 * the container is misused.
 *
 * A type of "void *" will allow tcon_check() to pass on any (pointer) type.
 *
 * Example:
 *	// Simply typesafe linked list.
 *	struct list_head {
 *		struct list_head *prev, *next;
 *	};
 *
 *	struct string_list {
 *		struct list_head raw;
 *		TCON(char *canary);
 *	};
 *
 *	// More complex: mapping from one type to another.
 *	struct map {
 *		void *contents;
 *	};
 *
 *	struct int_to_string_map {
 *		struct map raw;
 *		TCON(char *charp_canary; int32_t int_canary);
 *	};
