Realm Management Extension (RME)
====================================

FEAT_RME (or RME for short) is an Armv9-A extension and is one component of the
`Arm Confidential Compute Architecture (Arm CCA)`_. TF-A supports RME starting
from version 2.6. This chapter discusses the changes to TF-A to support RME and
provides instructions on how to build and run TF-A with RME.

RME support in TF-A
---------------------

The following diagram shows an Arm CCA software architecture with TF-A as the
EL3 firmware. In the Arm CCA architecture there are two additional security
states and address spaces: ``Root`` and ``Realm``. TF-A firmware runs in the
Root world. In the realm world, a Realm Management Monitor firmware (`RMM`_)
manages the execution of Realm VMs and their interaction with the hypervisor.

RME is the hardware extension to support Arm CCA. To support RME, various
changes have been introduced to TF-A. We discuss those changes below.

Changes to translation tables library
***************************************
RME adds Root and Realm Physical address spaces. To support this, two new
memory type macros, ``MT_ROOT`` and ``MT_REALM``, have been added to the
:ref:`Translation (XLAT) Tables Library`. These macros are used to configure
memory regions as Root or Realm respectively.

.. note::

 Only version 2 of the translation tables library supports the new memory
 types.

Changes to context management
*******************************
A new CPU context for the Realm world has been added. The existing can be used
to manage Realm context.

Boot flow changes
*******************
In a typical TF-A boot flow, BL2 runs at Secure-EL1. However when RME is
enabled, TF-A runs in the Root world at EL3. Therefore, the boot flow is
modified to run BL2 at EL3 when RME is enabled. In addition to this, a
Realm-world firmware (`RMM`_) is loaded by BL2 in the Realm physical address
space.

The boot flow when RME is enabled looks like the following:

1. BL1 loads and executes BL2 at EL3
2. BL2 loads images including RMM
3. BL2 transfers control to BL31
4. BL31 initializes SPM (if SPM is enabled)
5. BL31 initializes RMM
6. BL31 transfers control to Normal-world software

Granule Protection Tables (GPT) library
*****************************************
Isolation between the four physical address spaces is enforced by a process
called Granule Protection Check (GPC) performed by the MMU downstream any
address translation. GPC makes use of Granule Protection Table (GPT) in the
Root world that describes the physical address space assignment of every
page (granule). A GPT library that provides APIs to initialize GPTs and to
transition granules between different physical address spaces has been added.
More information about the GPT library can be found in the
:ref:`Granule Protection Tables Library` chapter.

RMM Dispatcher (RMMD)
************************
RMMD is a new standard runtime service that handles the switch to the Realm
world. It initializes the `RMM`_ and handles Realm Management Interface (RMI)
SMC calls from Non-secure.

There is a contract between `RMM`_ and RMMD that defines the arguments that the
former needs to take in order to initialize and also the possible return values.
This contract is defined in the `RMM`_ Boot Interface, which can be found at
:ref:`rmm_el3_boot_interface`.

There is also a specification of the runtime services provided by TF-A
to `RMM`_. This can be found at :ref:`runtime_services_and_interface`.

Test Realm Payload (TRP)
*************************
TRP is a small test payload that runs at R-EL2 and implements a subset of
the Realm Management Interface (RMI) commands to primarily test EL3 firmware
and the interface between R-EL2 and EL3. When building TF-A with RME enabled,
if the path to an RMM image is not provided, TF-A builds the TRP by default
and uses it as the R-EL2 payload.

Building and running TF-A with RME
----------------------------------

This section describes how you can build and run TF-A with RME enabled.
We assume you have read the :ref:`Prerequisites` to build TF-A.

The following instructions show you how to build and run TF-A with RME
on FVP for two scenarios:

- Three-world execution:  This is the configuration to use if Secure
  world functionality is not needed. TF-A is tested with the following
  software entities in each world as listed below:

  - NS Host (RME capable Linux or TF-A Tests),
  - Root (TF-A)
  - R-EL2 (`RMM`_ or TRP)

- Four-world execution: This is the configuration to use if both Secure
  and Realm world functionality is needed. TF-A is tested with the following
  software entities in each world as listed below:

  - NS Host (RME capable Linux or TF-A Tests),
  - Root (TF-A)
  - R-EL2 (`RMM`_ or TRP)
  - S-EL2 (Hafnium SPM)

To run the tests, you need an FVP model. Please use the :ref:`latest version
<Arm Fixed Virtual Platforms (FVP)>` of *FVP_Base_RevC-2xAEMvA* model. If NS
Host is Linux, then the below instructions assume that a suitable RME enabled
kernel image and associated root filesystem are available.

Three-world execution
*********************

**1. Clone and build RMM Image**

Please refer to the `RMM Getting Started`_ on how to setup
Host Environment and build `RMM`_. The build commands assume that
an AArch64 toolchain and CMake executable are available in the
shell PATH variable and CROSS_COMPILE variable has been setup
appropriately.

To clone `RMM`_ and build using the default build options for FVP:

.. code:: shell

 git clone --recursive https://git.trustedfirmware.org/TF-RMM/tf-rmm.git
 cd tf-rmm
 cmake -DRMM_CONFIG=fvp_defcfg -S . -B build
 cmake --build build

This will generate **rmm.img** in **build/Release** folder.

**2. Clone and build TF-A Tests with Realm Payload**

This step is only needed if NS Host is TF-A Tests. The full set
of instructions to setup build host and build options for
TF-A-Tests can be found in the `TFTF Getting Started`_. TF-A Tests
can test Realm world with either `RMM`_ or TRP in R-EL2. In the TRP case,
some tests which are not applicable will be skipped.

Use the following instructions to build TF-A with `TF-A Tests`_ as the
non-secure payload (BL33).

.. code:: shell

 git clone https://git.trustedfirmware.org/TF-A/tf-a-tests.git
 cd tf-a-tests
 make CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-none-elf- PLAT=fvp DEBUG=1 ENABLE_REALM_PAYLOAD_TESTS=1 all

This produces a TF-A Tests binary (**tftf.bin**) with Realm payload packaged
and **sp_layout.json** in the **build/fvp/debug** directory.


**3. Build RME Enabled TF-A**

The `TF-A Getting Started`_ has the necessary instructions to setup Host
machine and build TF-A.

To build for RME, set ``ENABLE_RME`` build option to 1 and provide the path to
the `RMM`_ binary ``rmm.img`` using ``RMM`` build option.

.. note::

 ENABLE_RME build option is currently experimental.

.. note::

 If the ``RMM`` option is not specified, TF-A builds the TRP to load and
 run at R-EL2.

.. code:: shell

 git clone https://git.trustedfirmware.org/TF-A/trusted-firmware-a.git
 cd trusted-firmware-a
 make CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-none-elf- \
 PLAT=fvp \
 ENABLE_RME=1 \
 RMM=<path/to/rmm.img> \
 FVP_HW_CONFIG_DTS=fdts/fvp-base-gicv3-psci-1t.dts \
 DEBUG=1 \
 BL33=<path/to/bl33> \
 all fip

``BL33`` can point to a Non Secure Bootloader like UEFI/U-Boot or
the TF-A Tests binary(**tftf.bin**) from the previous step.

This produces **bl1.bin** and **fip.bin** binaries in the **build/fvp/debug**
directory.

TF-A can also directly boot Linux kernel on the FVP. The kernel needs to be
`preloaded` to a suitable memory location and this needs to be specified via
``PRELOADED_BL33_BASE`` build option. Also TF-A should implement the Linux
kernel register conventions for boot and this can be set using the
``ARM_LINUX_KERNEL_AS_BL33`` option.

.. code-block:: shell

 cd trusted-firmware-a
 make CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-none-elf- \
 PLAT=fvp \
 ENABLE_RME=1 \
 RMM=<path/to/rmm.img> \
 FVP_HW_CONFIG_DTS=fdts/fvp-base-gicv3-psci-1t.dts \
 DEBUG=1 \
 ARM_LINUX_KERNEL_AS_BL33=1 \
 PRELOADED_BL33_BASE=0x84000000 \
 all fip

The above command assumes that the Linux kernel will be placed in FVP
memory at 0x84000000 via suitable FVP option (see the next step).

The ``bp.virtioblockdevice.image_path`` option presents the rootfs as a
virtio block device to Linux kernel. It can be ignored if NS Host is
TF-A-Tests or rootfs is accessed by some other mechanism.

If TF-A was built to expect a preloaded Linux kernel, then use the following
FVP argument to load the kernel image at the expected address.

.. code-block:: shell

 --data cluster0.cpu0=<path_to_kernel_Image>@0x84000000         \


.. tip::
 Tips to boot and run Linux faster on the FVP :
  1. Set the FVP option ``cache_state_modelled`` to 0.
  2. Disable the CPU Idle driver in Linux either by setting the kernel command line
     parameter "cpuidle.off=1" or by disabling the ``CONFIG_CPU_IDLE`` kernel config.

If the NS Host is TF-A-Tests, then the default test suite in TFTF
will execute on the FVP and this includes Realm world tests. The
tail of the output from *uart0* should look something like the following.

.. code-block:: shell

Four-world execution
********************

Four-world execution involves software components in each security state: root,
secure, realm and non-secure. This section describes how to build TF-A
with four-world support.

We use TF-A as the root firmware, `Hafnium SPM`_ is the reference Secure world
component running at S-EL2. `RMM`_ can be built as described in previous
section. The examples below assume TF-A-Tests as the NS Host and utilize SPs
from TF-A-Tests.
